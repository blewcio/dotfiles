# Autonomous Multi-Agent Product Team

An autonomous system of AI agents that collaboratively handle the complete software development lifecycle, from product concept to delivery.

## Overview

This system provides 6 specialized agents that work together like a real product team:

| Agent | Role | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **product-designer** | Product Design | Captures product vision, defines user stories, creates concept documents |
| **ux-ui-designer** | UX/UI Design | Creates wireframes, user flows, design systems, ensures accessibility |
| **software-architect** | Technical Design | Designs architecture, chooses tech stack, creates ADRs |
| **product-manager** | Project Management | Breaks down work into tickets, manages backlog, tracks progress |
| **software-developer** | Development | Implements tickets, writes tests, follows architecture patterns |
| **qa-engineer** | Quality Assurance | Validates work, runs tests, ensures quality standards |

```

**Note**: For CLI-only, API, or backend projects without UI, you can skip Phase 2 (UX/UI Design) and go directly from Concept to Architecture.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize a New Project

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-new-app
```

Then say to Claude:
```
"Initialize agent project workflow"
```

This creates the `.agents/` directory structure:
```
.agents/
├── concept.md              # Product concept (product-designer output)
├── architecture.md         # Technical design (software-architect output)
├── backlog.md             # Master ticket list (product-manager output)
├── status.md              # Project dashboard
├── tickets/               # Individual ticket files
│   ├── TICKET-001.md
│   ├── TICKET-002.md
│   └── ...
└── decisions/             # Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
    ├── 001-tech-stack.md
    └── ...
```

### 2. Concept Phase - Define Product Vision

Work with the product designer to capture your idea:

```
"I want to discuss my project idea with the product designer"
```

The product-designer agent will:
- Ask clarifying questions about the problem you're solving
- Define user stories and success criteria
- Identify constraints and assumptions
- Create `.agents/concept.md`

**You review and approve** the concept before moving forward.

### 3. Architecture Phase - Design Technical Solution

Transition to architecture:

```
"The concept looks good, move to architecture phase"
```

The software-architect agent will:
- Read the approved concept
- Design system architecture
- Choose appropriate technology stack
- Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Generate `.agents/architecture.md`

**You review and approve** the architecture.

### 4. Planning Phase - Create Tickets

Transition to planning:

```
"Architecture approved, create tickets"
```

The product-manager agent will:
- Break down architecture into small tickets (2-8 hours each)
- Organize tickets into logical sprints
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Map dependencies between tickets
- Create `.agents/backlog.md` and `.agents/tickets/TICKET-*.md`

**You review and approve** the backlog.

### 5. Development Phase - Build the Product

Check what to work on:

```
"Show project status"
```

Get next ticket:

```
"Get next ticket"
```

Assign to developer:

```
"Assign TICKET-001 to software developer"
```

The software-developer agent will:
- Read ticket requirements
- Follow architecture patterns
- Write clean, tested code
- Update ticket status
- Mark as "Dev Complete" when ready

Run QA validation:

```
"Run QA on TICKET-001"
```

The qa-engineer agent will:
- Validate against acceptance criteria
- Run all tests
- Check code quality
- Mark as "QA Pass" or "QA Fail" with feedback

Repeat until all tickets are complete!

### 6. Delivery Phase - Ship It!

When all tickets pass QA:

```
"Show project status"
```

Output:
```
🎉 All tickets complete!
Project Status: DELIVERY phase
Ready to ship! 🚀
```

```

### Example 2: Web App (With UX/UI Design)

Building a web-based productivity dashboard:

```
You: "Initialize agent project workflow"
→ Creates .agents/ directory

You: "I want to build a productivity dashboard web app with the product designer"
Designer: "What problem are you trying to solve? Who are the users?"
[Discovery conversation...]
Designer: Creates .agents/concept.md
You: Review and approve

```

## Tips

### Start Small
Begin with a simple project to learn the workflow before tackling complex systems.

### Review Each Phase
Take time to review and refine each phase document. Good concept → better architecture → cleaner tickets.

### Use Status Checks
Run `"Show project status"` frequently to see progress and next actions.

### Trust the Process
The agents follow established software engineering practices. Let them guide the workflow.

### Iterate and Refine
If a ticket is too large or unclear, ask the product manager to split it or clarify.

### Regression Testing
Run long regression tests once at the end of a sprint, not after every ticket.

### Documentation Updates
Update documentation and specifications after each sprint to keep them in sync with changes.

## Troubleshooting

### "No tickets available for development"
All ready tickets are in progress or blocked by dependencies. Check project status to see what's blocking progress.

### "Cannot transition to next phase"
Current phase validation failed. Check error message for missing requirements.

### "Ticket failed QA"
Review QA report in ticket file for specific issues. Developer agent can fix and resubmit.

### "Lost track of project state"
Run `"Show project status"` to see current phase and progress.

### "Want to change concept after starting development"
You can edit `.agents/concept.md` manually, but may need to revisit architecture and tickets if changes are significant.

## Advanced Usage

### Multiple Developers
Assign different tickets to separate developer instances:
```
"Assign TICKET-005 to software developer A"
"Assign TICKET-006 to software developer B"
```

They work independently, updating different tickets.

### Custom Workflows
You can manually edit `.agents/` files at any time:
- Refine concept after architect review
- Add tickets to backlog mid-development
- Skip phases if you have existing design docs

### Integration with Git
Commit after each phase:
```bash
git add .agents/
git commit -m "Complete architecture phase"
```

This creates an audit trail of decisions.

## Design Philosophy

**Guided Workflow**: You approve transitions between phases, ensuring alignment.

**Markdown-Based State**: All state in version-controlled markdown files (no databases or complex tools).

**Small Tickets**: 2-8 hour tickets minimize risk and enable steady progress.

**Quality Gates**: QA validation ensures each ticket meets standards before marking complete.

**Traceability**: Every decision documented (concept, architecture, ADRs, tickets).

**Standalone**: Works offline, no external dependencies or cloud services required.
